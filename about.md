My name is Christian.  I am a Senior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  My areas of study include Computer Science, Mathematics, and Philosphy.  I enjoy developing algorithms and solving complex problems.  I always try to pay extreme attention to detail.

I tend to be a generalist when developing my skills.  I am always open to diversifying my knowledge and learning new things.  I prefer to be well rounded and knowledgable in an array of different topics rather specializing in just a few.
