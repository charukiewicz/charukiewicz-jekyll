My name is Christian.  I work for [Roompact](https://www.roompact.com) and I am a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I am a developer and a thinker.  I am pretty good at math and I pay extreme attention to detail.

I like thinking about algorithms and using Linux.  I hate bloatware.
