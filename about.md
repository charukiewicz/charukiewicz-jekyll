title: About Me
---

My name is Christian.  I am a Senior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  My areas of study include Computer Science, Mathematics, and Philosphy.  I enjoy developing algorithms and solving complex problems.  I always try to pay extreme attention to detail.

I have a strong technical background from one of the most difficult CS programs in the country, but my true ambition is to work in the capacity of Product Manager.  I thoroughly enjoy being in a role that is somewhere between an engineering team, a sales team, and a design team, with a focus on coming up with features and functionality that people love using.  I believe I thrive in this type of environment and I will certainly develop my career in this direction.

I tend to be a generalist when developing my skills.  I am always open to diversifying my knowledge and learning new things.  I prefer to be well rounded and knowledgable in an array of different topics rather specializing in just a few.
