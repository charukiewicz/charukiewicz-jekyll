My name is Christian.  I work for [Roompact](https://www.roompact.com) and I am a Senior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  My areas of study include Computer Science, Mathematics, and Philosphy.  I enjoy developing algorithms and solving complex problems.  I always try to pay extreme attention to detail.

I am a dedicated Linux user.  I value the flexibility and control that Linux offers me, as a development environment, as a server, and for personal computing.

I try to be a generalist in developing my skills.  I am interested in learning about virtually anything.  I like to know something about everything.
