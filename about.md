My name is Christian.  I work for [Roompact](https://www.roompact.com) and I am a Senior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  My areas of study include Computer Science, Mathematics, and Philosphy.  I enjoy developing algorithms and solving complex problems.  I always try to pay extreme attention to detail.

I am a dedicated Linux user.  I value the flexibility and control that Linux offers me, as a development environment, as a server, and for personal computing.

I tend to be a generalist when developing my skills.  I am always open to diversifying my knowledge and learning new things.  I prefer to be well rounded and knowledgable in an array of different topics rather specializing in just a few.  I am not a dilettante, however.  I do not shy away from commitment towards learning something when doing so is necessary.
