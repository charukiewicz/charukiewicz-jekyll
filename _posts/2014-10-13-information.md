### The Information Problem

A couple of months ago, while faced with a number of design decisions in a project I was working on, I decided to sit down and qualify the fundamental principles of supplying information to someone.  I felt that there was certainly a systematic way to approach the problem of attempting to serve someone the information that they were either looking for or expecting to receive.  In my case, I was working on an email notification system.

It quickly became quite evident that there were certain decisions I could make that would be desirable to the end user, and other decisions that could make receiving the desired information a painful process.  Ultimately, after a lot of thinking, I came up with what I believe to be four fundamental principles that are always relevant when the goal is to convey information in any way, shape, or form to another individual.

The four principles, each of which I will discuss in greater detail below, are as follows:

1. Clarity
2. Relevance
3. Accessibility
4. Density
