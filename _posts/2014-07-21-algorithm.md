### What is an Algorithm?

I think that when most people hear the word 'algorithm' they tend to imagine some mathematician or software engineer doing some complex mathematical or computer related task.  This is a correct assumption.  Mathematicians, programmers, software developers, and engineers all regularly use algorithms to complete various professional or academic tasks.  But I think that people oftentimes do not really understand what algorithms really are, and that their reach extends far beyond the realm of the various aforementioned professionals.

So what is an algorithm?  Here is a definition from [Professor Jeff Erickson](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~jeffe/) from the University of Illinois:

>An algorithm is an explicit, precise, unambiguous, mechanically-executable sequence of elementary instructions.

This is one of the first things that I was met with when I took his [Algorithms](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~jeffe/teaching/algorithms/) course as a senior computer science student.  This definition is good.  I like this definition because it captures exactly what an algorithm is in just a few words.  However, this definition is still very intimidating.  I do not think it helps people imagine anyone other than a mathematician or software developer using this definition.
