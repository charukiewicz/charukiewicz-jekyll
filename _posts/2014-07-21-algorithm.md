### What is an Algorithm?

I think that when most people hear the word 'algorithm' they tend to imagine some mathematician or software engineer doing some complex mathematical or computer related task.  This is a correct assumption.  Mathematicians, programmers, software developers, and engineers all regularly use algorithms to complete various professional and academic tasks.  It is algorithms that play a key role in critical developments in science and technology.  Algorithms have been and continue to be used in developing the world we live in today.  But I think that people oftentimes do not really understand what algorithms really are, and that their reach extends far beyond the realm of the various aforementioned professionals and significant scientific developments.

So what is an algorithm?  Here is a definition from [Professor Jeff Erickson](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~jeffe/) from the University of Illinois:

>An algorithm is an explicit, precise, unambiguous, mechanically-executable sequence of elementary instructions.

This is one of the first things that I was met with when I took his [Algorithms](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~jeffe/teaching/algorithms/) course as a Senior.  This definition is great.  I like this definition because it captures exactly what an algorithm is in just a few words.  However, this definition is still very intimidating.  I do not think it helps people move away from the image of the mathematician or software engineer I described above.

Let's try another definition.  The following is my own definition of the word 'algorithm'.  It ignores the rigorous requirements that algorithms in an academic setting must meet (as is described in the definition quoted above).  It does, however, capture the very essence of what an algorithm is.

>An algorithm is a sequence of steps that, when followed, will solve a particular problem.
